General Ecommerce Marketplace: Technical Foundation and Enhanced Workflow 
System Architecture Overview 
High-Level Diagram 
[Frontend (Next.js)]  
    |  
[Sanity CMS] <------> [Product Data API]  
    |  
[Third-Party APIs] <------> [Shipment Tracking / Payment Gateway] Component Descriptions 
Frontend (Next.js): 
For frontend next js frame work for making UI Ux.
Backend (Sanity): 
For backend I preferred sanity to fetch the data and store in database.
Third-Party APIs: 
1. Shipment Tracking API (ShipEngine): Fetches real-time shipping updates and generates tracking 
details. 
2. Payment Gateway (Stripe): Processes secure transactions and confirms payment status. 
Authentication (Clerk): 
Handles user signup, login, and session management. 
Integrates with Sanity CMS to store user data securely. 
Libraries:
React: react use for add different icons.
Redux: for add to cart functionality.
Shadcn: for different types of components like carusel, dropdown menu and any other.
 
1.	Workflows:
o	Product Browsing:
1.	User searches for products -> Frontend sends API request to Sanity CMS.
2.	CMS responds with product data -> Products displayed dynamically.
o	Order Placement:
1.	User adds items to the cart -> Sends order details to Sanity CMS.
2.	CMS saves the order -> Payment processed through Payment Gateway.
3.	Confirmation sent to user -> Shipment info fetched via third-party API.
 2.4 Shipment Tracking 
Process: 
After order placement, shipment details are updated using ShipEngine.2.5 Inventory Management

Real-time tracking information is displayed to the user on the frontend. 
Product stock levels are managed in Sanity CMS. 
Real-time stock updates are fetched from Sanity CMS. 
Out-of-stock products are added to wishlist instead of cart. 
In-stock products can be added to cart and proceed to checkout. 
Standard product browsing, cart management, wishlist, and order placement. 
Inventory management and real-time stock updates.
